# Guessing-Game
A Guessing Game built in Python and Tkinter!  Except, there's a twist - the computer will guess the number you're thinking of! (the application version is only supported on macOS at the moment, the `.py` script is in here too so if you're on windows you can run it using that)

## How does it work?
It uses the binary search algorithm to narrow down the results, which gives it a time complexity of O(log n).

### Troubleshooting
#### I cannot open this because it's not from a verified developer!
Right click on the file, then click `Open`, and you will be asked that you're sure you want to open this file.  Click "Ok" or "Yes" or "Open" and there you go!

#### It gives me an error!
Well it worked fine on my computer so you probably entered something wrong.
Unless you're trying to make it break - then you succeeded, congratulations!
Make sure you're entering only numbers in the lower bound and upper bound!
